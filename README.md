# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project presents a Plant Disease Detection System designed to enhance agricultural practices by  utilizing machine learning for the early identification of plant diseases. The system is developed using  TensorFlow and Streamlit.

## Technology Stack
TensorFlow: For building and training the machine learning model.
Streamlit: For creating a web-based interface to interact with the model.
Python: Primary programming language used in the project.
